								TESLA ROADSTER


	Tesla is a company which makes electric cars. My favorite Tesla model is the Roadster, which was launched in 2020. The Roadster is the 2nd
fastest electric supercar, that is street legal. Some supercars are not legal because of their high speed, but this car is. In my opinion, out of all
the colours, a red finish looks the most luxurious on the Tesla. Some features of the roadster are quick acceleration, safety, and aero efficiency.

        I like Tesla because of their reliability, as its powerful, safe, and cool features like falcon doors that make it a high quality product. 
Furthermore, the cars they make are eco-friendly and perform well. I like roadster because it reaches a high speed of 60 miles per hour in just 1.9 
seconds and 100 miles per hour in just 4.2 seconds. “The Tesla Roadster is faster than the Bugatti Chiron,”  CEO of Tesla said. The roadster has a 
range of 620 miles in full charge, which means we can go from Mehsana to Mumbai in a single charge. Its price is $200,000. This may seem expensive, 
but compared to supercar’s price of crores, it is cheap.  

	Tesla made its first roadster for its CEO Elon Musk, and gifted him in the year 2008. Supercars use tons of gallons of petrol and gas;
however, Tesla is focusing more on renewable resources for energy to protect the environment from pollution. This is also a big step in the direction
of using renewable energy as a fuel source.
