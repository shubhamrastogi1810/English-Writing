My Favorite Dish 
		
		My favorite dish is Dosa and I like having it with Sambhar and coconut chutney.
This dish originated in India, and it is basically a rice pancake made with the fermented batter of
Urad dal and rice. Historian P. Thankappan Nair states, “Dosa originated in the Udupi town of present-day
Karnataka, India.” This dish originated in South India because of the huge production of paddy.  South-indian
farmers have cultivated rice for a long time as their main crop. Therefore, they like to eat dishes made from
rice. “According to food historian K. T. Achaya, dosa (as dosai) was already in use in the ancient Tamil country
around the 1st century AD, as per references in the Sangam literature.” Dosa has many varieties like plain dosa,
masala dosa, paneer dosa, and more. Adding different ingredients like chopped tomatoes and onions to a dosa makes
it uttapam.

	Dosa is made of urad dal and rice fermented batter. Its masala includes  spices like turmeric, mustard, 
and salt according to taste. It takes nearly 5-7 minutes for one dosa to cook. It is easy to cook and tasty too.
Some people say that dosa is junk food, as it has high levels of calories in the masala, such as mashed potatoes.
So, as a healthier option, have the masala of chopped vegetables, with a side of hot sambhar and cold coconut chutney. 
I like to have it once a week. You should try it too.
