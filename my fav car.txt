									TESLA ROADSTER

	Tesla is a company which makes electric cars. My favorite Tesla model is  a Roadster which was launched in 2020. 
This is the new electric supercar which is street legal. Some supercars are not legal because of  their high speed  but this car is.
Its red colour is my favorite as it looks very premium on the car. Some of the features are acceleration, safety and aero efficiency.

	I like Tesla because of its powerful, safe, and cool electric cars they make as they are eco-friendly, high on performance and 
some cool features like falcon doors. I like roadster because of a high speed of 60 miles in just 1.9 seconds. and 100 miles in just 4.2
seconds and has a range of 620 miles in full charge. Its price is $2,00,000 which is a bit expensive but compared to supercars price of 
crores it is cheap. 

	“The Tesla Roadster is faster than the Bugatti Chiron,”  CEO of Tesla said.Tesla made its first roadster for his ceo Elon Musk and
gifted him in the year 2008. Tesla is focusing on more renewable energy to use it as a energy source and also protects the environment from 
pollution and not using petrol/diesel as a fuel. This is also a good step to  move in the direction to use renewable energy as a fuel source.
